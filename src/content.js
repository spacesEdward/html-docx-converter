const str ="<h2>Overview of the new structure</h2><p>The diagram below (Figure 1) shows the organisation of the outcomes and content for Mathematics K–2, illustrating the important role working mathematically plays across all areas of mathematics.</p><p>Evidence highlights the need to strengthen connections between concepts in mathematics. The new organisational structure reflects this.</p><h2>Content structure</h2><p>Outcomes and their related content remain organised into three areas:</p><ul><li>Number and algebra</li><li>Measurement and space</li><li>Statistics and probability.</li></ul><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><img src=\"https://objectstorage.ap-sydney-1.oraclecloud.com/p/02AV_LzkTgezQ6kn1HURVVyd0Hmvso-xKp3LLVaqayyK7YjWQWYdgYXVny3Tyhin/n/ax7hzzupr0lq/b/NESA-TEST-STORAGE/o/62670-1633241829423\"  alt=\"Figure 1 gives a diagrammatic overview of the outcomes and content and the relationship of working mathematically to all areas of the syllabus.\" title=\"Figure 1.png\" width=\"779px\" style=\"width: 779px;\"></p><p class=\"ql-align-center\">Figure 1: Overview of the syllabus structure.</p><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><br></p><h3>Working at different Stages</h3><p>The content presented in a Stage represents the typical knowledge, skills and understanding that students learn throughout the Stage. It is acknowledged that students develop at different rates and in different ways. There will be students who have not achieved the outcomes for the Stage(s) prior to that identified with their Stage of schooling.</p><p>For example, some students will achieve Stage 1 outcomes during Year 1, while the majority will achieve them by the end of Year 2. Other students might not develop the same knowledge, skills and understanding until Year 3 or later.</p><p>The syllabus is written with the flexibility to enable students to work at different Stages in different strands. For example, students in Early Stage 1 could be working on Stage 1 content in the Number and Algebra strand, while working on Early Stage 1 content in the Measurement and Geometry strand. Teachers are best placed to make decisions about when students need to work at, above or below Stage level. This recognises that outcomes may be achieved by students at different times across Early Stage 1 and Stage 1.</p><p><br></p><h3>Balance of content</h3><p>The amount of content within a given outcome is not necessarily indicative of the amount of time spent engaging with the respective outcome. Teachers use formative and summative assessment to determine instructional priorities and the time needed for students to achieve expected outcomes.</p><p>The content organisers are not intended to be hierarchical. They describe in more detail how the outcomes are to be interpreted and used, and the intended learning appropriate for the Stage. They support teachers to diagnose where students are in their learning.</p><p>In considering the intended learning, teachers make decisions about the sequence and emphasis to be given to particular groups of content and make necessary adjustments to their teaching, based on the needs, interests and abilities of their students.</p><p><br></p><h3>Parts A and B</h3><p>Mathematics substrands outline the development of several concepts. Where Stages span 2 years of learning (for example, Stage 1 includes Year 1 and Year 2) there are concepts that may need to be addressed earlier or later in the Stage.</p><p>To assist programming, the content in these substrands has been separated into two parts, A and B, such as in ‘Representing whole numbers A’ and ‘Representing whole numbers B’:</p><ul><li>the first part typically focuses on early concept development</li><li>the second part builds on these early concepts.</li></ul><p>The content across parts A and B relate to the same Stage-based outcomes. Teachers can choose which content, from part A and/or part B, to address based on students’ prior learning, needs and abilities.</p><p>In Stage 1, part A does not equate to Year 1 only. For example, when teaching a Year 2 class the teacher may need to address or consolidate some concepts within part A prior to addressing concepts in part B. Similarly, when teaching a Year 1 class, the teacher may decide to address concepts in part B based on the students’ prior learning, needs and abilities.</p><p>The part A and part B structure of the content:</p><ul><li>provides flexibility for teachers in planning teaching and learning programs based on the current needs and abilities of students</li><li>helps better visualise the progression and growth of concepts within a Stage of learning</li><li>makes clear how content builds to support deep understanding in each substrand.</li></ul><p>Teachers and schools need to decide how to program the two parts of these substrands within a Stage.</p><p>Discussion between teachers about what content has been addressed within each year of teaching will be an important part of planning and programming. Teachers should consider:</p><ul><li>when students may have learnt some concepts from part B content in the first year of a Stage, consolidation of these concepts in the second year of a Stage may be needed</li><li>revisiting concepts regularly to build deeper understanding of mathematical concepts</li><li>providing extension of certain concepts based on students’ needs and abilities.</li></ul><p><br></p><h2>Making connections through related content</h2><p>Many connections exist between areas of mathematics. Mathematical concepts are often interrelated or interdependent on the development of each other; for example, the concepts of area and multiplication. Where appropriate, examples have been included of related outcomes and content that could be addressed in parallel. The suggested connections are not an exhaustive list of the ways that mathematical concepts are related or could be taught.</p><p><br></p><h2>Working mathematically</h2><p>The working mathematically processes in the NSW Mathematics syllabus are:</p><ul><li>communicating</li><li>understanding and fluency</li><li>reasoning</li><li>problem-solving.</li></ul><p>Students learn to work mathematically by using these processes in an interconnected way. The coordinated development of these processes results in students becoming mathematically proficient.</p><p>When students are working mathematically it is important to help them to reflect on how they have used their thinking to solve problems. This assists students to develop <em>mathematical habits of mind.</em></p><p>Students need many experiences that require them to relate their knowledge to the vocabulary and conceptual frameworks of mathematics.</p><p><br></p><h2>Elaborating the processes</h2><p>In becoming proficient&nbsp;users of mathematics, students must make connections between mathematical ideas. For example, the connections students make between spatial and numerical representations of quantity support the development of their understanding of measurement.</p><p>Working mathematically usually involves using one or more processes. Solving problems in mathematics requires understanding of concepts and relations as well as the capacity to communicate the reasoning.</p><p>To highlight how these processes are interrelated, in Mathematics K–2 there is one overarching working mathematically outcome.</p><p>Working mathematically requires students to:</p><ul><li>explore and connect mathematical concepts [understanding/fluency]</li><li>choose and apply efficient techniques to solve problems [fluency/problem-solving]</li><li>communicate their thinking and reasoning coherently and clearly [communicating/reasoning].</li></ul><p>The working mathematically outcome describes the thinking and doing of mathematics. In doing so, the outcome indicates the breadth of mathematical actions that teachers need to emphasise.</p><p><br></p><h2>Embedding the processes</h2><p>As in the Australian Curriculum, the following processes are embedded within the outcomes and content:</p><ul><li>communicating</li><li>understanding and fluency</li><li>problem-solving</li></ul><p>The nature of each working mathematically process, and its place in the syllabus, is briefly described below.</p><p><br></p><h3>Communicating</h3><p>Students need knowledge of mathematical content and how to express their ideas about mathematics so that others can understand them.</p><p>The ongoing interaction with mathematical vocabulary helps to reinforce students' understanding, not only of the words themselves, but also of the mathematical ideas the words express.</p><p>Students are communicating mathematically when they describe, represent, explain and reason about mathematical situations, concepts, methods and solutions.</p><p>Students communicate through a variety of representations: in written, oral, graphical or symbolic form, through actions, gestures or signing. Making connections between representations, known as representational fluency, supports understanding of mathematics.<a href=\"#_ftn3\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">[3]</a></p><p>Encouraging students to reflect on and discuss the strategies they used and the knowledge and skills they required assists them to learn to work mathematically. Students learn to think more deeply by:</p><ul><li>reflecting on what they have done</li><li>organising their thoughts</li><li>deciding how to express those thoughts.</li></ul><p>They need opportunities to assess their own understanding, make connections and compare ideas.</p><p><br></p><h3>Understanding and fluency</h3><p>Understanding involves making cognitive connections between some new material or some new experience and our existing ideas.</p><p>Students demonstrate conceptual understanding when they:</p><ul><li>connect related ideas</li><li>represent concepts in different ways</li><li>identify commonalities and differences between aspects of content</li><li>describe their thinking mathematically</li><li>use concepts&nbsp;to solve new and unfamiliar problems.</li></ul><p>Conceptual understanding supports retention. Because facts and methods learnt with understanding are connected, they are easier to remember and use, and they can be reconstructed when forgotten.</p><p>Students’ communication of their understanding reveals their mathematical fluency. Mathematical fluency is developed when students<a href=\"#_ftn4\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">[4]</a>:</p><ul><li>choose and use appropriate strategies</li><li>carry out procedures flexibly, accurately and efficiently</li><li>recall factual knowledge and concepts to solve problems</li><li>use known facts, and reason about relationships to find solutions.</li></ul><p><br></p><h3>Problem-solving</h3><p>Some problems in mathematics can be readily solved based on past experience. When confronted with a routine mathematics problem, the student is able to apply a known correct solution method. In contrast, non-routine problems are problems for which the student does not immediately know a usable solution method. Non-routine problems require productive thinking because the student needs to invent a way to understand and solve the problem. Students need experience with both routine and non-routine mathematics problems.</p><p>In becoming proficient mathematics problem-solvers, students:</p><ul><li>learn how to form mental representations of problems</li><li>apply mathematical relationships</li><li>devise novel solution methods when needed.</li></ul><p>A fundamental characteristic needed throughout the process of solving problems in mathematics is flexibility. Flexibility develops through the broadening of knowledge required for solving non-routine problems rather than just routine problems.</p><p><br></p><h3>Reasoning</h3><p>‘Reasoning is the glue that holds everything together, the lodestar that guides learning.’ (National Research Council, 2001, p. 129).</p><p>Mathematics is a reasoning and creative activity. Mathematical reasoning is thinking <strong>logically about quantitative and spatial relationships. </strong>It is key to later achievement in mathematics.</p><p>As mathematical reasoning develops, students appreciate that mathematics makes sense, and can be understood. They develop an increasingly sophisticated capacity for logical thought and actions.</p><p>Reasoning has been embedded within the outcomes and content. The syllabus also identifies useful opportunities to develop mathematical reasoning in the content. In particular, the syllabus highlights reasoning about:</p><ul><li>quantity</li><li>relations</li><li>patterns</li><li>spatial relations</li><li>spatial structure.</li></ul><p>This is not an exhaustive list of when and how students may reason about mathematical ideas and concepts. The highlights assist teachers in knowing the kind of reasoning students have the opportunity to apply.</p><p><br></p><h4>What might reasoning look like?</h4><p>Students need to become aware of how they are using&nbsp;mathematics to reason about familiar problems. This gives them a sense of how their developing mathematical knowledge and skills can be applied in a range of situations.</p><p><br></p><h4>Spatial reasoning in a Kindergarten class</h4><p>Transcript from classroom example:</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">A group of children is working with pattern blocks. They started working independently, making patterns, pictures, models and quite abstract designs.</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">One of the students notices the resemblance between the yellow blocks and the picture of a honeycomb in a book open on the bench nearby.</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\"><em>We could make that </em>[pointing]<em> with these yellow blocks. Let’s see how big we can make it! </em></p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">They begin and soon use up all the yellow blocks.</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\"><em>There aren’t any more yellow blocks. </em></p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\"><em>Let’s use some of the red ones, or even some of the green ones to make a yellow one.

One student answered 0 and 2. Again Ms L asked if anyone had a different answer. This time the students thought a little longer before stating that no other answers were possible.</p><p>The following is a transcript from the classroom discussion:</p><p>Ms L:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>How do you know? </em></p><p>Student:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;… [Thinking…]</p><p><em>Two is only a small number, so you cannot use 3, 4 or 5.</em></p><p>Ms L:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Crosses out 3, 4 and 5]</p><p>Student:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>If you use 2 you must use 0.</em></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>If you don’t use 2, … 0 and 1 are too small.</em></p><p>The student reasons about the relationships between the numbers. ‘Two is only a small number’, so if you are adding together whole numbers chosen from 0 to 5, they cannot be bigger than 2.</p><p>Ms L:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>On your desks are six sticky notes.
