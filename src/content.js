It is acknowledged that students learn at different rates and in different ways. There will be students who have not achieved the outcomes for the Stage(s) prior to that identified with their Stage of schooling.</p><p>For example, some students will achieve Stage 1 outcomes during Year 1, while the majority will achieve them by the end of Year 2. Other students might not develop the same knowledge, skills and understanding until Year 3 or later.</p><p>The syllabus is written with the flexibility to enable students to work at different Stages in different outcomes. For example, students in Early Stage 1 could be working on the Stage 1 Vocabulary outcome while also working on Early Stage 1 Phonic knowledge. Teachers are best placed to make decisions about when students need to work at, above or below Stage level. This recognises that outcomes may be achieved by students at different times across Early Stage 1 and Stage 1.</p><p>  <br></p><h3>Balance of content</h3><p>The amount of content within a given outcome is not necessarily indicative of the amount of time spent engaging with the respective outcome. Teachers use formative and summative assessment to determine instructional priorities and the time needed for students to achieve expected outcomes.</p><p>The content organisers are not intended to be hierarchical. They describe in more detail how the outcomes are to be interpreted and used, and the intended learning appropriate for the Stage. They support teachers to diagnose where students are in their learning.</p><p>In considering the intended learning, teachers make decisions about the sequence and emphasis to be given to particular groups of content and make necessary adjustments to their teaching, based on the needs and abilities of their students.</p><p>  <br></p><h3>Making connections through related content</h3><p>Many connections exist between areas of oral language, reading and writing. Foundational skills often develop in an interrelated manner. For example, developing skills and knowledge in the Creating Written Texts outcome is closely connected to developing skills and knowledge in the Vocabulary outcome. Where appropriate, examples have been included of related outcomes and content that could be addressed in parallel. The suggested connections are not an exhaustive list of the ways that foundational skills and knowledge are related or could be taught.</p><p>  <br></p><h2>Text requirements K–2</h2><p>Understanding and creating a wide range of texts is central to the study of English. In K–2 the term 'texts' refers to print, digital or spoken forms of communication and includes fiction and nonfiction works. Many types of texts are easy to recognise by their subject matter, forms and structures, such as imaginative, informative and persuasive texts. Texts have evolved over time for the purpose of communicating effectively with a range of audiences. Sometimes a number of elements from different types of texts can be included in a single text, <a href="https://australiancurriculum.edu.au/f-10-curriculum/english/key-ideas/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">resulting in a hybrid text</a>. For example, an imaginative text such as a narrative will predictably have language features such as action verbs and descriptive noun groups, but may also contain visual features such as speech bubbles, diagrams and subheadings more typically seen in informative texts.</p><p>The act of creating texts involves:</p><ul>  <li>selecting the language appropriate to purpose</li>  <li>adapting and experimenting with language</li>  <li>using textual elements from different styles, modes and text forms.</li></ul><p>  <br></p><h3>Literature</h3><p>Literature is defined as a body of work that has enduring personal, social, cultural or aesthetic value. It comprises a dynamic and evolving range of fiction and nonfiction texts from diverse contemporary, historical and cultural contexts.</p><p>Literature should be readily available to students in the classroom and updated regularly.</p><p>Across a <strong>year</strong> of learning, teachers must give students daily opportunities:</p><ul>  <li>    <strong>To be read to:</strong> Being read to supports children in acquiring new vocabulary from a text, gives students access to texts beyond their immediate means and supports the development of reading as pleasure. Independent reading should not supplant being read to. Where reading aloud is not accessible for students, they should be read to using their preferred communication form(s).  </li>  <li>    <strong>To read decodable texts:</strong> Decodable texts support beginning readers to use decoding strategies and practise their developing reading skills. Provide decodable texts for beginning readers in Early Stage 1, and as needed for students in Stage 1 and beyond.  </li>  <li>    <strong>For wide reading: </strong>Once students can consistently use phonic knowledge to decode words, the use of decodable texts does not need to continue. At this point, students should be reading a wide range of texts of increasing complexity and varied topics.  </li>  <li>    <strong>For wide writing: </strong>Students need to practise and experiment with creating written texts in English and all other learning areas. Specific opportunities for writing may be found in texts being read, or in other experiences that can provide real contexts, audiences and purposes.  </li></ul><p>  <br></p><h3>Text selection</h3><p>As teachers identify what their students need to learn at particular points in time, they can select texts to facilitate the learning. A well-chosen text enables students to practise, enhance and transfer knowledge and skills they already have and apply this learning to new contexts.</p><p>Across a year of learning, the selection of texts must give students opportunities to engage with a variety of texts, including:</p><ul>  <li>texts by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples</li>  <li>Australian literature</li>  <li>picture books</li>  <li>poetry and texts that feature wordplay and figurative language</li>  <li>classic and contemporary literature which include cultural and linguistic diversity</li>  <li>narrative texts that include examples of character</li>  <li>texts that provide information in different forms</li>  <li>texts that include persuasive arguments presented in different forms</li>  <li>plays</li>  <li>decodable texts</li>  <li>a range of digital texts (Stage 1).</li></ul><p>  <br></p><h3>Diversity of learners</h3><p>Text selections should respond to the individual needs of students. Texts should be selected that either support or extend students’ reading.</p><p>EAL/D students should be provided with opportunities to engage with and respond to texts in their home language so that they can make meaningful connections between their home language and Standard Australian English. For children for whom Auslan is their first language, this should include a variety of signed texts, which may be live or recorded.</p><p>It is important to provide the opportunity for students to respond to and create texts using their preferred communication techniques and systems. This may include assistive technology, and augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) systems, such as:</p><ul>  <li>gesture</li>  <li>signing</li>  <li>real objects</li>  <li>photographs</li>  <li>pictographs</li>  <li>pictograms</li>  <li>braille</li>  <li>speech-to-text and text-to-speech applications</li>  <li>digital technology.</li></ul><p>  <br></p><h3>Text complexity</h3><p>Text complexity may vary in:</p><ul>  <li>ideas or knowledge</li>  <li>structure</li>  <li>vocabulary</li>  <li>sentence complexity</li>  <li>levels of meaning or subtlety.</li></ul><p>  <br></p><p>Most texts combine aspects of simple and complex features. As learning progresses, students can sustain reading of more complex texts for longer periods of time.</p><p>Teachers should preview all texts that students study in class. This allows teachers to identify potential areas for targeted teaching.</p>`;export default str;
